# Personally Identifiable Information

### What is it?
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information[<sup>1</sup>](https://github.com/iamzoh/InformationSecurity/blob/master/PDFs/Protecting%20the%20Confidentiality%20of%20PII%20(NIST).pdf). There's a key caveat here is that it's important to realize that non-PII can become PII whenever additional information is made publicly available -- *in any medium and from any source* -- that, when combined with other available information, could be used to identify an individual[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program/rules-and-policies-protecting-pii-privacy-act).

### Who has it?
The government collects public records on all residents in two major forms: 
* personal public records 
* business public records.

Personal public records can be compromised of: 
* birth/death certificates 
* marriage certificates
* criminal records
* driving records
* sex offender records
* missing persons reports
* voter registration   
   
Business public records consist of:
* real estate appraisals
* spending reports
* quarterly reports
* liens
* legal judgements
* bankruptcy filings[<sup>3</sup>](https://www.dmv.org/public-records/). 

This is not an exhaustive list of public records. The government has various other pieces that keep a paper trail outlining a person's life. This may be concerning but you have to understand that it's much, much easier for someone to find more about you through your social media.

Most Americans use some type of social media. In fact, close to 70% of US adults use at least one social media site. The number is even higher for younger people living in an urban setting. Over 70% share their true name on social media. Over 90% use a picture of themselves. Over 95% share their gender. Over 85% share their age. Over 95% share their current city. Over 80% have an open contacts list. Most importantly, over 66% of social media users share their usernames across platforms essentially creating a virtual spider web of their social footprint. All of this means it's not too difficult to find someone on the internet[<sup>4</sup>](http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/social-media/).

### Where to find it?
Public records can be accessed through the government or private companies. The government will offer it for free while private firms will ask for a fee, the tradeoff being how time consuming the process becomes. The [Freedom of Information Act](https://www.foia.gov/about.html) provides the public the right to request access to records from any federal agency. This Act is quite important as a major pillar for transparency in the United States Government. 

###### Pro-tip: Make a FOIA request on yourself [here](https://www.foia.gov/report-makerequest.html) and you can ask for all the information the government has on you. Beware it will take at least 3 months to get a response and you will most likely be rejected.

### Protect yourself
The best way to keep your information privy is to not share information in the first place. It's easier to ask someone for information, than to hack their accounts for the same information, this concept is called [social engineering](https://github.com/iamzoh/InformationSecurity/blob/master/PDFs/Social%20Engineering.pdf).

You don't need to share your full name and contact information to order a pizza. Try initials. Not everyone deserves to know your email address. Use tools such as [10-minute mail](https://10minutemail.com) or [Temp mail](https://temp-mail.org/en/) to create temporary email addresses for any website that doesn't need your primary. Pizza Hut also doesn't need your phone number. So you accidentaly gave a fake number ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  

Be careful with your payment options too. Use a tool like [Privacy](https://privacy.com/) to create virtual cards that protect your money. You can create virtual credit cards and use fake billing details, set spending limits, assign them to specific merchants, and delete cards anytime. This way if *INSERT_BUSINESS_HERE* has a security breach and leak credit card information that they stored in plain text, you are a little better off.

Use good password practices. *U6vZ1Epm* is not a good password because it's short and hard to remember. *IHelpedBezosMakeMoney* is a much easier to remember and harder for a machine to brute force. Make use of password managers too such as [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) or [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/). Password managers allow you to make your passwords complex without having to remember each individual one.

Make use of privacy settings on all your social media. Your friend's list and work history do not have to be public. If some information is private on your Facebook but public via LinkedIn, it's essentially completely public.

Encrypt your laptop. Password protect it too.

2-factor authentication on everything. Invest in a 2-factor key such as [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/store/) if you hate getting a phone call from Google.

### TL;DR
Don't use your real information online, dummy!
