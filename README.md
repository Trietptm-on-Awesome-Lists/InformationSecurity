# A small piece of the information security puzzle

This repository contains information on some information security topics. This is step 1 in a project which aimed to create a library that specifically explained internet security.

Here is my work so far:
- What is [Personally Identifiable Information](https://github.com/iamzoh/InformationSecurity/blob/master/Personally%20Identifiable%20Information.md)?
- The history behind [passwords](https://github.com/iamzoh/InformationSecurity/blob/master/Passwords.md) 
- What is [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://github.com/iamzoh/InformationSecurity/blob/master/GDPR.md)?
- What is the [C.L.O.U.D Act](https://github.com/iamzoh/InformationSecurity/blob/master/CLOUD%20Act.md)?

This is an ongoing project.
