# Personally Identifiable Information

### What is it?
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information [<sup>1</sup>](https://github.com/iamzoh/InformationSecurity/blob/master/PDFs/Protecting%20the%20Confidentiality%20of%20PII%20(NIST).pdf). There's a key caveat here is that it's important to realize that non-PII can become PII whenever additional information is made publicly available -- *in any medium and from any source* -- that, when combined with other available information, could be used to identify an individual [<sup>2</sup>](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program/rules-and-policies-protecting-pii-privacy-act).

### Who has it?
The government collects public records on all residents in two major forms: personal public records and business public records. The first can be compromised of birth/death certificates, marriage certificates, criminal records, driving records, sex offender records, missing persons reports, voter registration and various other pieces that keep a paper trail outlining a person's life. Business public records consist of real estate appraisals, spending reports, quarterly reports, liens, legal judgements, and bankruptcy filings [<sup>3</sup>](https://www.dmv.org/public-records/). This is not an exhaustive list of public records.
