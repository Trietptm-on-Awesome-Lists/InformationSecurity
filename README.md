# Personally Identifiable Information

### What is it?
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information[<sup>1</sup>](https://github.com/iamzoh/InformationSecurity/blob/master/PDFs/Protecting%20the%20Confidentiality%20of%20PII%20(NIST).pdf). There's a key caveat here is that it's important to realize that non-PII can become PII whenever additional information is made publicly available -- *in any medium and from any source* -- that, when combined with other available information, could be used to identify an individual[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program/rules-and-policies-protecting-pii-privacy-act).

### Who has it?
The government collects public records on all residents in two major forms: 
* personal public records 
* business public records.

Personal public records can be compromised of: 
* birth/death certificates 
* marriage certificates
* criminal records
* driving records
* sex offender records
* missing persons reports
* voter registration   
   
Business public records consist of:
* real estate appraisals
* spending reports
* quarterly reports
* liens
* legal judgements
* bankruptcy filings[<sup>3</sup>](https://www.dmv.org/public-records/). 

This is not an exhaustive list of public records. The government has various other pieces that keep a paper trail outlining a person's life. This may sound scary but you have to understand that it's much, much easier for someone to find more about you through your social media.

### Where to find it?
Public records can be accessed through the government or private companies. The government will offer it for free while private firms will ask for a fee, the tradeoff being how time consuming the process becomes. The [Freedom of Information Act](https://www.foia.gov/about.html) provides the public the right to request access to records from any federal agency. This Act is quite important as a major pillar for transparency in the United States Government. 

###### Pro-tip: Make a FOIA request on yourself [here](https://www.foia.gov/report-makerequest.html) and you can ask for all the information the government has on you. Beware it will take at least 3 months to get a response and you will most likely be rejected.
