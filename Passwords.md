# Passwords

### The first password
The history of computer passwords can be traced back to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and their Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). Each user needed a unique password to access the operating system and usage time was tracked. All of the passwords were stored in plain text on the system. the problem passwords addressed was that they had multiple terminals which would be used by multiple people with each person having their own private set of files. A password was a straightforward solution for allowing private access[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.wired.com/2012/01/computer-password/). 

Now a password is not the only way to solve the problem. You could ask for a piece of information that only a unique user would know, such as their mother's maiden name or the street they grew up on. The reason this methodology was not selected is because [storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card) was expensive in the early computing days and nobody wanted to allocate many resources to passwords.

### The first password hack
The first password hack also came on this MIT CTSS. One of the engineers wanted more time on the shared operating system but he was limited to a set number of hours per password (per person). So he found and printed the master list of passwords on the operating system for more hours on the computer.
