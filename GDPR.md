# General Data Protection Regulation

GDPR aims to re-define data privacy laws to better regulate the current digital world. The regulation was designed to create uniform laws across Europe, to give European citizens more control over their data, and reshape the way organizations around the world approaches data privacy. GDPR goes into effect May 25th 2018.

### Background
For most of the Internet Age, Europe has been following the [Data Protection Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive) with regard to processing personal data of data subjects. This directive was passed in 1995, and went into effect in 1998. In the last 20 years the world has become much more reliant on personal data. The biggest issue with DPD was that it was a EU directive, meaning it was not legally binding for member states. Each member state has to enact their own regulation. Also foreign organizations are not subject to enforcement under current laws, since they aren't hosted in EU member states. GDPR is an attempt to unify data protection laws across the EU, and for all organizations hosting EU citizen data. 

## GDPR Changes

#### Extra-territorial Applicability
GDPR applies to all organizations processing personal data of data subjects located in the European Union, regardless of the organizations own location. Previously, DPD did not apply to foreign organizations. GDPR will apply to data controllers and processors. Data controllers are defined as organizations that collect data from EU data subjects for example Facebook, Twitter, or American Airlines. Processors are defined as organizations that process data on behalf of controllers for example Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure. 

#### Penalities
Any organizations in breach of GDPR can be fined for violations. Serious violations will result in a fine of 4% of annual global sales revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater. Lighter violations will result in a fine of 2% of annual global sales revenue or €10 million, whichever is greater. These are very serious fines, and quite necessary to adequately discourage breaches. A 4% fine will bankrupt many of the S&P top 100 companies. A 2% fine will seriously handicap many of those companies, and bankrupt a small minority. In 2016, Apple had $215 billion in revenue and $45 billion in net income. A 4% fine would be close to $9 billion or a fifth of yearly profits. Apple is arguably the most valuable company in the world, and even they would be crippled by a serious GDPR violation. American Airlines would lose approximately 90% of their annual profits. Retail giant Wal-Mart would be $10 billion in the red. 

#### Data Protection Officers
If the organization's core business involves processing operations which require regular monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, the organization must appoint a Data Protection Officer. The DPO must report to the highest level of management (CEO), and have enough qualifications and resources to adequately to carry out their responsbilities.

## Data Rights
#### Breach Notifications
Organizations will have to notify customers within 72 hours of first becoming aware of a breach. The regulation applies to both controllers and processors. Equifax breach was announced 40 days after the company discovered a breach (breach was officialy discovered 75 days from the initial hack). 72 hours is a very quick turnaround. 

#### Consent
Organizations must request any personal data using an intelligble, easily accessible form with plain language. No longer will long, verbose End User License Agreements (EULA) and Terms and Conditions (T&C) will be allowed. 

#### Right to Access
Data Subjects have the right to ask whether their personal data is being processed, if so, where and for what purpose? The data controller has to provide any and all personal data to data subjects in an electronic format for free.

#### Data Portability
Data Subjects have the right to obtain all personal data from a controller and share with another controller. For example, you could rescind consent from Facebook and share that personal data with Twitter.

#### Data Erasure
Data subjects have the right to be forgotten. Data subjects can withdraw consent for their data to be processed. The data controller must erase their personal data, and stop third-parties from processing said data. 

## Privacy by Design
GDPR requires that systems are designed with privacy in mind from the ground up. 

#### Data Minimization
Controllers and Processors can only host data absolutely essential for the completion of their services. 

#### Default Opt-Out
Data Subjects will have to opt-in to sharing any personal data with controllers and processors. By default, systems must be designed to ask for consent beore sharing any information.

## Concerns

#### Enforcement
The biggest concern with any regulation is enforcement. GDPR has defined serious fines for any violations, though concerns stem from this line in Article 83 of GDPR. "In any event, the fines imposed shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive." Will a company ever be fined 4% of their global annual revenue? Mostly likely no. It's hard to imagine even a 2% fine. Any large organization will fight tooth and nail to prevent such a large fine. I believe soon after GDPR gooes into effect there will be a landmark case with a serious fine that will set precedent for future violations. 

#### Separate treatment
What's to stop organizations to treat other data subjects different from EU citizens? It's very cost inefficient to have two different set of terms and conditions for users. GDPR will most likely become the world standard for personal data privacy laws. Any organization that chooses the other road will be barred from a massive First World market. 


## What's next?
GDPR goes into effect May 25th 2018. In the next month, you will most likely receive many emails from organizations reviewing and updating their terms and conditions. By the end of this year, or next, there will be at least one serious violation of GDPR and a precedent set for realistic fines and sanctions.
